# LeetNGreet

LeetNGreet Buddy is a social media‚Äìstyle platform for programmers to share their progress, approaches, and thoughts on LeetCode problems. Inspired by Twitter, it lets users post, follow, like, and comment while building a supportive coding community.

## üéØ Project Goals

Create a community-driven space where people can post about LeetCode problems they‚Äôve solved.

Allow users to share general thoughts/tips not tied to a specific problem.

Enable engagement through likes, comments, and following.

### Provide two feeds:

- General feed (all posts).

- Following feed (posts from people you follow).

## üõ† Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js (Dockerized for development, deployed on Vercel for production).

Backend: Next.js API routes (initially).

Database: MongoDB (local for dev, MongoDB Atlas for production).

Authentication: Auth0 (users stored in MongoDB).

## üë§ Users

Authenticated via Auth0.

Users stored in MongoDB.

Can follow/unfollow other users.

## üìù Posts

### Two types of posts:

Problem-specific posts: tagged to a LeetCode problem.

General posts: like tweets, not tied to a problem.

### Posts support:

Likes üëç

Comments üí¨

## üìñ LeetCode Problems (Tagging)

MVP will use a seeded problem list instead of scraping.

problems.json will store a set of common LeetCode problems, for example:
```
[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Two Sum", "slug": "two-sum", "difficulty": "Easy" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "Add Two Numbers", "slug": "add-two-numbers", "difficulty": "Medium" }
]
```

This JSON will be imported into a MongoDB collection during setup.

Future improvements: scraping LeetCode with Puppeteer, using Python scripts, or querying LeetCode‚Äôs unofficial GraphQL API.

## üì¶ MVP Scope

### The minimum viable product will include:

- Auth0 authentication & user accounts.

- User profiles (basic).

- Ability to create posts (problem-specific or general).

- Likes and comments on posts.

- Following system.

- General feed and following feed.

- Seeded LeetCode problems for tagging.

## üöÄ Future Ideas

- Expand problem database via scraping or GraphQL API.

- Add hashtags (e.g., #DynamicProgramming, #Graphs).

- Code snippet support in posts.

- Leaderboards, notifications, and trending discussions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide
### 1. Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/allenreinoso28/leetcode-buddy.git
cd leetngreet
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file with the following keys:
```
AUTH0_SECRET=your_auth0_secret
AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_auth0_client_secret

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/leetcodebuddy
```

### 4. Seed LeetCode Problems

Create a problems.json file (sample shown above). Then run a seed script:
```
npm run seed:problems
```

This will populate your MongoDB problems collection.

### 5. Run with Docker (Development)
```
docker compose build
docker create network leet
```
```
docker compose up 
```
or 
```
docker compose watch
```

The app will start at http://localhost:3000.

### 6. Deploy (Production)

Frontend + API ‚Üí Vercel

Database ‚Üí MongoDB Atlas

Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard.

# Security Plans

## üîê Authentication & User Security

Use NextAuth.js or your own JWT-based auth flow ‚Üí both work seamlessly with Vercel.

Store secrets (JWT secret, OAuth client secrets, etc.) in Vercel Environment Variables, not in code.

Always hash passwords with bcrypt (if you‚Äôre not using OAuth).

Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (/login, /signup) using something like Upstash Rate Limit
.

## üåê API Security (Vercel Functions or External Backend)

Don‚Äôt expose MongoDB URI directly ‚Äî backend API functions should handle queries, not the client.

Use CORS: if you add a separate backend service, restrict it to your frontend‚Äôs Vercel domain.

Add Helmet (if Express) or secure headers in Vercel‚Äôs config for better HTTP protections.

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Atlas Security

Network Access: Allow only Vercel‚Äôs IP ranges or use MongoDB Atlas + Vercel Integration (secure by default).

Database User: Create a limited user role (read/write only for your app‚Äôs DB).

TLS/SSL: MongoDB Atlas enforces this by default ‚Üí keep it enabled.

Rotate DB credentials regularly (easy with Vercel env vars).

## üöÄ Vercel Deployment Security

Keep API keys, DB URIs, JWT secrets in Environment Variables via Vercel dashboard.

Don‚Äôt check .env files into GitHub. Add .env to .gitignore.

Use preview environments safely (Vercel auto-generates them for PRs). Make sure sensitive endpoints (like admin routes) still require authentication even in previews.

Enable Vercel‚Äôs HTTPS (automatic on all deployments).

## üõ°Ô∏è Frontend Security

Store JWTs in httpOnly cookies (not localStorage).

Sanitize any user-generated content (comments, posts, profile bios).

If you use React, rely on dangerouslySetInnerHTML only if sanitized.

Protect from CSRF if using cookies (NextAuth has built-in CSRF protection).
